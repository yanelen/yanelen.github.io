### Overview

Two players can play this game on one machine.

The game is preceded by typing each player's name in the text field and confirm the name by pressing the "enter" key. The first player is Player X and the second player is Player O.

The game will then begin. Players alternate placing Xs and Os following the screen that tells whose turn it is.

After each game, either player clicks the "REMATCH" button to start a new game.

The game board keeps track of Player X vs. Player O wins.
